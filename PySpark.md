# Introduction to PySpark

PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, designed for big data processing and analytics. It allows Python developers to leverage Spark's powerful distributed computing capabilities to efficiently process large datasets across clusters. PySpark is widely used in:

- Data Analysis  
- Machine Learning  
- Real-time Data Processing

## Important Facts to Know

### 🔹 Distributed Computing  
PySpark runs computations in parallel across a cluster, enabling fast and scalable data processing.

### 🔹 Fault Tolerance  
Spark automatically recovers lost data using lineage information in **Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)**.

### 🔹 Lazy Evaluation  
Transformations are not executed immediately. Instead, Spark builds an execution plan and runs only when an **action** is triggered, allowing major performance optimizations.

## What is PySpark Used For?

PySpark enables processing and analyzing massive datasets that cannot fit on a single machine. Running across multiple machines makes big data workloads faster, scalable, and reliable.

You can use PySpark to:

- ✅ Perform batch and real-time processing on large datasets  
- ✅ Execute SQL queries on distributed data  
- ✅ Build scalable machine learning models  
- ✅ Stream real-time data from sources such as Kafka or TCP sockets  
- ✅ Process graph data using GraphFrames
